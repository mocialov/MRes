The purpose of this package is to provide a function to train Neural Networks using the Rprop algorithms (in all his four variations: Rprop+, Rprop-, IRprop+, IRprop-)

In Demo_Rprop_1.m is possible to observe the procedure to correctly declare and train a Neural Network.
In Demo_Rprop_2.m the 4 algorithms are compared.

NOTE: It's important, before training the network, to convert the labels to the internal class system. The reason is that internally many functions assume the labels to be a complete sequence starting from 1(i.e. 1-5 is okay; 1,2,4,5 no). Labels can be translated using RNN.lab2class. In order to translate back to the labels, you can simmetrically use RNN.class2lab.
